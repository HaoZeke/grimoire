There has been a strong push towards `jupyter` notebooks (nowadays known as [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub)) for working with code,
in particular `python` code. This is actually against my own principles, as the
`.ipynb` notebooks are basically unreadable without a server and the export
functionality is still pretty poor. I will detail some of caveats faced here,
which are common to the usage of Jupyter.

At the moment the collection consists of:

1. [LaTeX and JupyterHub](https://grimoire.science/latex-and-jupyterhub/index.html) - Generating outputs locally

Using Jupyter locally and generating outputs with tlmgr for latex
