This is about a [new site](https://rgoswami.me) which will have some of my thoughts.

## Why

I really like this site I built. For a very long time I thought I would never
need another. It is actually something I like so much it is still on my CV.

## But

Honestly I have mostly made another site because I recently came across
rgoswami.me on the open market and snapped it up. I have been looking for a
place to put more rambling thoughts or shorter posts and I think it'd help to
have something under my own name too. The scope of this new project is better
described [there anyway](https://rgoswami.me/posts/rationale).

The main reason for it is just the ease of usage offered by `ox-hugo`. The
single file multiple post system is just really neat, and is something I cannot
really set up with metalsmith without a whole lot of trouble.

Moving forward, I do intend to keep this site up and running, especially since I
feel like the referencing system is really neat, but I might migrate some other
things off. Mostly I think it'd be nice to have collections here, which are more
academic in nature, and any and every other kind of post might just be on the
new place.

## Err..

This is actually a good example of a post I really shouldn't have here, but
well. Last time. Is there any significance of this happening on Valentines Day?
Well, maybe I just like lining up all my endings in a row.
