## Introduction
Based on the mode of reactor operation, reactors may be:

* Batch
* Continuous
    - Plug Flow
    - Continuously Stirred

Continuously operating reactors are also further subdivided on the basis of their homogeneity.

## Characteristics
As enumerated by @missen1999introduction

* Each batch is a closed system
* The total mass of each batch is fixed
* The volume or density of each batch varies (w.r.t time)
* The energy of each batch varies (w.r.t time)
* The reaction (residence) time $t$ for all ements of a fluid is the same.
* The operation of the reactor is inherently in the unstead-state (eg. composition w.r.t time)
* The batch is uniform due to efficient stirring (composition, temperature .etc)
