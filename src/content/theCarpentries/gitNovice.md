# Background

To paraphrase [the checkout
proceedure](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout), I need
to take part in an hour long community discussion to clarify and comment on the
teaching material.

## Scope

I intend to cover the [git section of the curriculum](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/), I guess in many ways the
UNIX shell is more or less an optional pre-requisite, it would make things
easier for the learner.

## General Comments

- I dislike that there is no scope to cover multiple upstream remotes
- I do not like the structure of the lesson, for me, `Exploring History` would
  have come after `Ignoring Things`.

# Lesson Notes

Here I will record my thoughts and comments about each episode, as they are called.

## Automated Version Control

- [Episode link](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/01-basics/index.html)

### Caveats

- Version control is not an `undo`
- VC systems are meant to be to `track changes`
- VC systems should be introduced as **collaborative tools**
- Paper writing is not really a good workflow for `git`, especially given the
  rise of [overleaf](https://overleaf.com) and [authorea](https://www.authorea.com).

## Setting Up Git

- [Episode link](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup/index.html)

### Pros

- I like that a wide variety of editors are covered
- The proxy is described at the appropriate point

### Caveats

- Proxy details would need more explanation
- This segment needs to be curtailed to make it more managable for the audience
