### About
A while ago to ease my transitions from system to system, before I decided to
use a fully fledged configuration manager and
[pug](https://github.com/HaoZeke/pug "Link to pug")(my fork of [the AUR one](https://github.com/Ventto/pug "Link to AUR pug") adapted to be used on
multiple systems), I started committing a list of packages I keep.

It turns out that `git` is really well suited to putting one line reviews so I
guess I'll just start with them.

### Asymptote
This I installed to get [pp](https://github.com/CDSoft/pp "Link to pp") to work
properly. Turns out I really didn't need `pp` but
[asymptote](asymptote.sourceforge.net "Link to aymptote") is a pretty neat
vector graphics language so I'll keep it.

### Firefox Nightly
This is a no brainer. For a long time I refused to switch away from `waterfox`
because I really needed some of the depreciated XUL addons, like
[FlashGot](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flashgot/ "Link to Flashgot") for my
IDM integration.

Eventually I learned to live with [uGet](ugetdm.com/ "Link to uGet").

<!-- TODO make this a whole post -->

### Gnome Sudoku
I don't actually play sudoku, also unlike the mobile versions there is no way to
keep notes so I guess this is a miss.

### Gnome Twitch
Honestly the gnome versions of things are just sort of neat.

### htmldoc
This is a build requirement for sphinxdocs amongst other things.

### jnettop
Useful little tool for checking what's hogging my data.

### Jupyter Notebook
I hate jupyter-notebooks and everything they entail. Python must die. Sadly a
lot of things are distributed ONLY as jupyter notebooks. Needed to even convert
the `.ipynb` files to a more readable `.py` format.

### lab
[This](https://github.com/zaquestion/lab) is like a souped up
[hub](https://github.com/github/hub) for gitlab.

### mlocate
Better than locate.

### Pianobar
Works best with a VPN and [proxychains-ng](https://github.com/rofl0r/proxychains-ng).

### qTox
This was a failure. There seem to be nothing but pedos on the public server.
Deleted with prejudice.

### Skype
Sadly necessary.

### sshuttle
Transparent proxy server that works as a poor man's VPN. Forwards over `ssh`.
Doesn't require admin. I never need this. Usually reverse proxies over `ssh` work
well enough.

### stack
The Haskell Tool Stack. `` `nuff`` said.
 
### streamlink
A lifesaver.
 
### Trillian
Weirdly I bought this for my google hangouts needs.
 
### tsocks
Another transparent proxy thing. Never got the hang of it. Proxychains is
better.
 
### uGet
FOSS over IDM!
 
### uGet Integrator
Another reason to stick to standard browsers.
 
### VLC
Installed this for trying to work with network streams, but `mpv` with
`smplayer` is much better.
