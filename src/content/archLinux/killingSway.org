** Context
For the past few months I have been sporadically working on a document which was
meant to convince other people (and me) to switch to wayland.

** Giving Up
Continuing from my previous article, I managed to modify my workflow to
workaround several wayland anti-patterns.

At this point I realized that my laptop was, inspite of my best efforts to use
native wayland apps, running a bunch of XWayland sessions.

That coupled with more growing pains explained in another post, convinced me to switch.
