### Chemistry JAM 2018 Syllabus

I found the [official syllabus](http://jam.iitb.ac.in/cy_syl.html) hard to read and print. Do not take the breakdown as indicative of any weightage. It's simply demarcated by the baseline dot (aka the full stop). This was too large to be tractable in a list.

### PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY
